I am helping people to make the right decisions, data-driven decisions. This is what drives my passion for deep diving into questions and problems, understanding them in detail with all their coherencies and turning them into precise solutions.

As a Data Analyst with a background in Project Management, I possess a creative problem-solving attitude. 
Currently, I am engaged in improving the quality of Connected Drive Functions through Data Analytics. 
I have gained a detailed understanding of the entire chain through a comprehensive analysis of the function's architecture. 
This has enabled me to provide targeted solutions to issues by analyzing test data while prioritizing key performance indicators. 
By leveraging this approach, I have significantly surpassed expectations in improving quality rates. 
My experience has taught me the value of factual insights over mere estimates and how to leverage the potential of data fully. 
I am confident I can leverage my expertise to optimize business processes, enabling companies to achieve their goals through data-driven insights.
